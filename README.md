### Description

Light Speed HTML Remover is a super fast HTML remover, when compiled it removes HTML of a file at a rate of 1 MB/second on a Pentium I 500 mhz

It's very easy to use, you only select a file, then HTML is removed, and then if you want to save the new file only click "Save Text" and you can save it to a text file.

Also the HTML remove function is in a reusable module so you can use it in your applications, code is clean and well commented.

Don't forget to vote!!! :) I will appreciate it.

Also all comments will be very appreciated.

Thanks.
